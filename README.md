# aadanpradaan

A new Flutter project.



## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
Steps:
Save your image (e.g., screenshot.png) in the same folder as README.md.

Commit and push both README.md and the image to GitHub.

GitHub will automatically show the image when viewing the README.

Do you want me to make it so the image is centered and smaller inside the README? That way it looks nicer on GitHub.
